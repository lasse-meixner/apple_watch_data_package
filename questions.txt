**General structure of the data:**

The data contains rows of very different nature. Some are, for example, workout entries, whilst others are measurements of some sort. Some of these measurements might be daily, some might be minute-/instantaneous.
Some of the measurements might be taken during workouts, some not. Others are workout specific. 
There seems to be an overall inconsistency in what is added as an extra column to an existing row objects (i.e. there might be a new HK[-] column for Hiking Workouts),
or added as an extra row. Both seem to be possible and happen.

The nature of a row entry is usually descernible from the "type". Workouts, however, have "type" NA, and are defined in "workoutActivityType".

*Value*

Some values are strings (e.g. for type = AppleStandHour). Those are forced to numeric (or NA) in preprocessing.

**Questions:**

- effect of humidity on heart rate when walking/running (controlling for intensity/speed)
    - humidity is measured once, heart rate is dynamic...
- effect of sleep on resting heart rate (using first pick up as proxy -> attenuated effect)
    - measured at daily level
    -> SLIGHT NEGATIVE BUT BARELY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. ATTENUATION FROM MEASUREMENT ERROR MIGHT BE SUBSTATIONAL.
- detailed analysis of speed & heart rate when running
